Repository for 2015 Group Assessed Exercise for University of Glasgow Masters Level course Human-Centred Security.

## Overview

The second assessed research exercise for Human Centred Security M is a **proactive password checker for minors**. A user interface that communicates the *strength of an authentication secret* and *guides minors to a desired strength level*. The exercise is to be completed in self-organising teams of no more than three members (i.e. the three contributors). Team members should consult literature and emerging thinking on assessing and communicating the strength of an authentication secret.  Consequently, teams can either elect to follow a **technical** or **non-technical** route in completing the exercise. This assessed exercise is worth **30%** of your mark.

Teams are expected to submit a body of work, either technical or non-technical, and a presentation. The presentation should be a video recording lasting 10-minutes (example structure: 3-minutes overview of the password meter, 2-minutes outlining an envisaged evaluation and a 5-minute reflection on the challenges in guiding minors to create effective authentication secrets).

The aim of the exercise is not technical brilliance but **communication**. Communication in terms of (1) guiding minors to create effective authentication secrets and (2) presenting and justifying design motivation and decisions using relevant evidence from literature.
